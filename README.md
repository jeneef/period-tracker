# Periodt. Silencing the Stigma
Women’s Welfare Warriors Periodt (WWW.) is a group of women addressing period stigma through education and advocacy. Our website, which would be expanded as an app, contains several components to uphold our mission of spreading awareness against period stigma, educating women, collaborating with Howard University organizations to successfully deliver information and feminine products worldwide, and partner with small business owners of color. 

The “Periodt Tracker” will track users’ menstrual cycles and alert them when their period is coming. The tracker displays ovulation dates and provides health insights for any symptoms users’ might be experiencing.  

The Periodt App also provides women with information related menstruation from what menstruation is and its purpose to tutorials of how to use menstrual products and DIYs to help with period pain. This feature will keep users updated and informed about their health.

The “Yoni Shop” is a very essential component of Periodt because it allows users to purchase organic products that will improve their menstrual health, partners with small black business to sell their products, donates to a woman in need with every purchase. Donations will be supplied to service organizations who help women who are homeless, incarcerated, and living in underserved countries. 

Lastly, “Menstrual Mentor” is an Artificial Intelligence feature for users’ who feel uncomfortable speaking about their period with other people, for example young girls living in a single parent home with their fathers. Users can ask menstrual mentor any questions they have about menstruation and Menstrual Mentor will respond with a solution in real time. Menstrual Mentor is a safe space and works to respond to users in a comforting and supportive way.
